Revision history for PostgreSQL extension colnames.

1.7.1
      - Removed the `$libdir/` prefix from the `module_pathname` directive,
        so that the module can be installed and found in any directory listed
        in `dynamic_library_path`.

1.7.0  2024-02-15T21:49:23Z
      - Added LICENSE file.
      - Improved documentation code formatting.
      - Added pure SQL example to the docs for those who can't install the
        extension. Thanks to Jim Nasby for the suggestion (#2)!
